# Salvatore Ventura

Hi!
now that you know my name, you will probably want to know a little more about me. I am a general-purpose, mostly self-taught programmer. I have programmed in many languages over decades (1) however I think there are too many languages out there, so I (currently) prefer **Python**. 

Every job has its own tools, which is why I believe that in problem-solving data-structures and algorithms come first.

I have acquired a lot of skills around *automation* and *virtualization*, including a big focus on **REST APIs**. 

For example, in my repositories, you will find [PyUnsplash](https://pyunsplash.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) and [PyPexels](https://pypexels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html),  as two Python wrappers for REST APIs.

Thank you for visiting my GitHub page and happy coding!

> (1)  Pascal, C, C++, Delphi, MATLAB, TCL, Bash shell, Java, Javascript, PERL, PHP, Python, Kotlin and probably something else that I forgot.
