<p>Hi!
now that you know my name, you will probably want to know a little more about me. I am a general-purpose, mostly self-taught programmer. I have programmed in many (^) languages over decades, however I think there are too many languages out there, so I (currently) prefer <strong>Python</strong>.</p>

<p>Every job has its own tools, which is why I believe that in problem-solving data-structures and algorithms come first.</p>

<p>I have acquired a lot of skills around <em>automation</em> and <em>virtualization</em>, including a big focus on <strong>REST APIs</strong>.</p>

<p>In my repositories, you will find Python wrappers for REST APIs, a Kotlin sample Android App, a cross-browser addon/extension for tab management, and more. Not everything I do ends up on github though.</p>

<p>Check below for further qualifications.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(^)  Pascal, C, C++, Delphi, MATLAB, TCL, Bash shell, Java, Javascript, PERL, PHP, Python, Kotlin and probably something.</p>
